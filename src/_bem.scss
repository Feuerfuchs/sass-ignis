/// BEM.
///
/// BEM is a methodology for structuring websites and is mostly known for it's CSS naming convention.
/// BEMIT is in extension of this methodology and allows you to give blocks a more fine-grained  purpose
/// than BEM alone would let you do.
///
/// Sass does support BEM quite well thanks to the ampersand (&) and the @at-root directive. However,
/// there is no way to make sure users adhere to the BEM or BEMIT methodology.
/// That's where the mixins in this file come into play: They automatically generate the right selectors
/// and perform checks regarding the nesting order, nesting depth, and so on.
///
/// There are comments in the mixins explaining what selector is generated. The EBNF grammar is as follows:
///
///   (* Shorthands for block, element, modifier, suffix *)
///   entity_shorthand = "b" "e" "m" "s" "t" ;
///   
///   (* One or multiple BEMIT entities that were generated with an earlier mixin invocation *)
///   existing_entities = "{" entity_shorthand { "," entity_shorthand } "}" ;
///   
///   (* A BEM entity that doesn't depend on a parent entity *)
///   generated_independent_entity = "block" ;
///   
///   (* A BEM entity that is attached to a parent entity *)
///   generated_attached_entity = existing_entities ( "__element" | "--modifier" | "@suffix" ) ;
///   
///   (* A selector created by the user, such as "&:hover", "> a", and so on *)
///   manual_selector_part = "[manual selector]" ;
///   
///   (* A part of the selector that may or may not be in the generated result *)
///   optional_selector_part = "(" ( existing_entities | manual_selector_part ) ")" ;
///   
///   (* One part of the selector *)
///   selector_part = existing_entities | manual_selector_part | optional_selector_part | generated_independent_entity | generated_attached_entity ;
///   
///   (* How the left and right selector are related, i.e. space means right is a descendant of left, and dot means right specializes left *)
///   selector_link = " " | "." ;
///   
///   (* The whole selector *)
///   selector = selector_part { ( selector_link ) selector_part } ;
///
